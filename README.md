# Composite_Likelihood

# Overview

This repository was developed in my undergraduate research at University of Campinas (UNICAMP). Composite likelihood is an alternative to maximum likelihood when we're working on high dimensions and we have to estimate many parameters. First of all, I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate a 5-Multivariate Normal distribuition in which the correlation between random variables depends on indexes lags, then I applied the pairwise likelihood (a Composite marginal likelihood) approach to estimate the parameters. In Temporal Series context, I used the pairwise likelihood to work with cDCC model for a large assets portfolio.
