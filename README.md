# Composite_Likelihood

# Overview

This repository was developed in my undergraduate research. Composite likelihood is an alternative to maximum likelihood when we're working with a high dimension and
we have to estimate many parameters. First of all, I used the Monte Carlo method to simulated a 5-Multivariate Normal distribuition in which the correlation between random variables depends on indexes lags. After that, I used on Temporal Series context, working with cDCC model for a large Assets portfolio.
