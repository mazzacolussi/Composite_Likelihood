# Composite_Likelihood

# Overview

This repository was developed in my undergraduate research at University of Campinas (UNICAMP). Composite likelihood is an alternative to maximum likelihood when we're working on high dimensions and we have to estimate many parameters. In Temporal Series context, I used the pairwise likelihood to work with cDCC model for a large assets portfolio.
